# momentum-clone

This was one of my first real project with AngularJS. I decided to clone the Momentum Dashboard - https://momentumdash.com/ - which is a Chrome plugin which replaces the new tabs in Chrome with a beautiful dashboard with a Todo list, the current time and quotes. My version is similar, except I added two more views with angular's ui-view. One view contains a google calander widget that's connected to my account and allows me to view what's happening this week. I also connected my cloned dashboard with two different APIs; one which pulls the current horoscope from the Onion's horoscope page, and a second that displays random Chuck Norris jokes. 

I pulled a dozen or so HD backgrounds from various locations and had my code randomly assign a new background on page refresh, in a way that mimics the Momentum page. 

As of right now, this project is broken, as the person who was maintaining the Onion Horoscope API completely changed how it works. I have plans to go back to this project and fix it, but those plans are low on my list of things to do. 

Overall, I was happy with this project.
